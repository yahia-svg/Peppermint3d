# Peppermint3d
This is my fully custom designed bed slinger. I tried to make it as structurally sound as possible, by using mostly metal components like the opengantry universal plate and a ridgid aluminum frame, whilst still being fairly simple so i'd be able to build it as a beginner
# Motivation
I made this project because I was completely new to designing 3d printers and I thought this would be a great first printer. Additionally, this would help me so much with developing other hardware projects because the 3d printing service that I use is slow and expensive.
